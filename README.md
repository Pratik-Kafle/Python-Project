# 📊 Student Feedback Survey Analysis  
**FutureIntern Internship Project | Python | Data Visualization | Sentiment Analysis**

## 🔍 Project Summary  
As part of my **FutureIntern analytics internship**, I analyzed student feedback data to uncover insights about teaching quality, assignment difficulty, and overall course relevance. This project helped me practice Python-based data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment categorization while learning to connect data to real-world impact.

---

## 🧠 Goals  
- Explore student survey data using beginner-friendly Python tools  
- Visualize feedback patterns across multiple teaching dimensions  
- Categorize overall student sentiment based on average ratings  
- Identify strengths and areas for improvement in course delivery  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills  

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** | Data cleaning, EDA, visualization |
| **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** | Interactive analysis and scripting |
| **Sentiment Bucketing** | Categorized average ratings into sentiment groups |
| **Bar Charts** | Visualized rating distributions and sentiment counts |

---

## 📈 Key Visuals  
- **Rating Distribution**: subplots showing how students rated each question  
- **Sentiment Bar Chart**: Shows most students rated the course as “Positive” or “Neutral”  
- **Average Feedback Rating Chart**: Horizontal bar chart summarizing average ratings across all feedback categories—highlighting top strengths and areas for improvement  

---

## 💡 Insights  
- **Top-rated**: “Well versed with the subject” and “Explains concepts in an understandable way”  
- **Moderate**: Presentation usage and assignment difficulty  
- **Lower-rated**: “Provide support for students going above and beyond” and “Course recommendation based on relevance”  
- **Sentiment**: Majority of students expressed “Positive” or “Neutral” sentiment
